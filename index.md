# Welcome to Naoto Shinohara's web page!
I'm Naoto SHINOHRA, a postdoctoral fellow in Japan.
I earned my PhD at Univ. Tokyo, where I studied community assembly of plants and insects in grasslands. The goal of my research is to disentangle what determines the biodiversity and membership of species that we observe in nature. To do so, I mainly use field sampling, stats, and simulation approaches.
