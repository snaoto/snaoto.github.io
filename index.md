# Welcome to Naoto Shinohara's web page!
I'm Naoto SHINOHRA, a postdoctoral fellow in Japan.
I earned my PhD at Univ. Tokyo, where I studied community assembly of plants and insects in grasslands. The goal of my research is to disentangle what determines the biodiversity and membership of species that we observe in nature.
