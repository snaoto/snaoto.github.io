# Welcome to Naoto Shinohara's web page!
I'm Naoto SHINOHRA, a postdoctoral fellow in Japan.
I earned my PhD at Univ. Tokyo, where I studied community assembly of plants and insects in grasslands. The goal of my research is to disentangle how the biodiversity and membership of species that we observe in nature are maintained and assembled. To do so, I mainly use field sampling, data analysis and synthesic approaches.
